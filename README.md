## üåç Vision

This project is not just another e-commerce backend ‚Äî it is built to **reflect Arab identity, culture, and traditions**.  
From the way people shop, to the way they interact, the platform is designed with our context in mind.

- Support for **dialects** like **Egyptian Arabic**, alongside **Modern Standard Arabic** and **English**.
- Inspired by Arab shopping traditions: before buying, people ask **family and friends**.  
  That‚Äôs why I integrated an **AI assistant** that allows customers to compare products, get recommendations, and receive guidance in their own language.

## üß© Business Logic

- **Multi-language & Dialects**: Arabic (MSA), Egyptian dialect, and English.
- **AI-powered chatbot**: Helps users compare products, understand needs, and make better purchase decisions.
- **Ask your friends** logic: Users can share links or recommendations before finalizing a purchase.
- **Discount by generosity**: After purchasing, a user receives a coupon to share with three friends ‚Äî reflecting the Arab tradition of generosity.
- **Role-based recommendations**: Personalized product suggestions based on roles and behavior.
- **Caching system**: In-memory cache to reduce DB load and improve speed.

## ‚ö° Performance Results

I focused heavily on **optimizing performance** to make the platform fast and scalable:

- **Chatbot response time**:
  - Before: ~6 seconds
  - After: **~3 seconds average** (50% faster)
  - Optimized using **caching + prompt engineering**.

- **Product Aggregation Queries**:
  - Before: ~1.5 seconds
  - After: **~30ms average** (95% faster)
  - Achieved via **MongoDB indexes + in-memory caching + query refactoring**.

- **Image Handling**:
  - Custom middleware compresses and optimizes uploaded images.
  - Reduced image size while improving quality ‚Üí faster product page loads.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Protection

- **Brute force prevention**: login and password reset attempts limited with cooldowns
- **Request limiting**: IP-based rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`.
- **OTP  (One-Time Password / Code) verification**: Two-factor authentication.
- **JWT with refresh tokens** for secure session management.
- **Account deactivation flow** with reactivation option before permanent deletion.
- **Validation** for all critical inputs (emails, passwords, product data , ...etc).

From struggling with non-working endpoints, to fixing critical bugs, to improving performance step by step.

Some highlights of the journey:

- Solving **hidden bugs** that blocked development for days.
- Refactoring repeated code to make it modular and scalable.
- Writing daily reports of progress, failures, and breakthroughs.
